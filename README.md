# Thut
new repository for my mods

#Thut Core
this contains some generic and helper classes used by a set of my mods.  It contains some maths classes, as well as some generic block and item classes.

#Dorfgen
This is my dwarf fortress world generator mod.  It loads in the exports from dwarf fortress legends mode.  It uses DFHack to get some extra data exported, see the contents of the samples directory in it.

#Misc
These are small, usually server-side only, mods.

##TODO
Update things to latest forge.

Update ThutTech for 1.9

Update Dorfgen to use 43.xx+ xml stuff for DF
